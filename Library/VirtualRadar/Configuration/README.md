# VirtualRadar.Configuration

Configuration objects for various services and for the application as a whole.



## Options

Classes with names that end with "Options" are intended to be used with the
`Microsoft.Extensions.Options` library. They are typically declared as mutable
records - mutable because the options library needs them to be mutable, records
because value equality can be useful with configuration settings.



## Settings

Classes with names that end with "Settings" are intended to be used with the
homebrew `ISettings` object.
