# VirtualRadar.Services

Implementations of service interfaces. Some services are exposed as plain old
classes, but if a service needs to be replaced with a mock for unit tests then
it is exposed as an interface and the implementation is often kept private.

Services are also declared as interfaces if they're the kind of thing that a
plugin might want to swap out at runtime with its own implementation.

These are implementations for services exposed at the root of the VirtualRadar
namespace as interfaces. Not *all* of them are here, sometimes it makes more
sense to have the implementation elsewhere. But most of them are here.
